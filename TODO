For anyone interested, here is a list of things we'd like to get done

1. Integration with Files. HelpDesk items should be allowed to have file
   attachements.

2. E-mail integration. E-mails sent to HelpDesk should create new HelpDesk
   entries.

3. Extend configuration to totally turn off data fields which aren't selected.
   For instance, turning off "Operating System" will turn off the field not
   only on the list screen, but also on the add/edit and view screens as well.

4. Add immediate population of phone number and contact e-mail fields when a
   requestor is selected from the pop-up box.

5. Possible use of HTMLArea for the comments box.
