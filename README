ABOUT

    This is the dotProject Help Desk Module.  If you would like to contribute
    to this project, please contact one of the maintainers.

PERMISSIONS

    The Help Desk uses built in dotProject permissions to its best abilities. The
    permission system is layed out as follows.

    Let our example user be Joe

    1. Joe will always have permission to edit his own Help Desk items, as long
    as he has at least read-only permissions to the Help Desk.

    2. Permissions to the Help Desk module overwrite company permissions. For
    instance, if Joe has read-write access to a company but has read only
    access to Help Desk, overall read only access will result. This means that
    Joe cannot create any new items and cannot edit any items which are not his
    own.

    2. Company permissions are used to determine access to Help Desk items. If
    Joe has read only permissions for company X and no other, he will be able
    to read items associated with company X, but that's all. If Joe has
    read-write access to company X, he will be able to create items for company
    X.  Having read only permission to a company will not allow Joe to create
    items for that company.  Joe must have read-write permissions to at least
    one company in order to be able to create new Help Desk items.

    3. On the configuration screen, there are two options of note. The first
    option has to do with the company which handles Help Desk items. If Joe has
    read-write access to company X, he will be able to assign items to users
    from company X. If a company is assigned in the configuration screen
    option, users from that company will be also visible in that list. This is
    done so that Joe can assign items to people from the company that hosts the
    Help Desk. The "requestor" list is limited to people from company X only.

    The second option has to do with items which have no company assigned. By
    default, those items are not editable by anyone except the item creator. If
    the items should be editable by anyone, turn the option on.
