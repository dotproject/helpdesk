NOTES

The HelpDesk module has company level permissions wrapped around it.  
So, if your friend is in company X and the ticket is assigned to company 
X, and you do not have perms to view info for company X you will not see 
that ticket.  You will need to have company X perms granted to you via
the User Admin module.
