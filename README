           -=     Help Desk 1.0.1 Release Notes     =-

This module has been HEAVILY overhauled to support many new features
of dotProject 2.1.3 and above.  The following are some of the changes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Icons in the images folder can be mapped to issue types, the format is
"ct" followed by the issue type number.  So for issue type 1 which is
"Application Error" you would have a file named "ct1.png"  The png file
should be 15 x 17 pixels to fit properly in the lists.

Database prefixes are now supported and all database routines are
now run through dotProject's built in query functions.

Reporting functionality is new and is still under development.

File uploading is integrated with dotProject 2.1.5 and depends on
the updates to the "Files" module that are included and can be found at:
http://dotproject.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/dotproject/branches/stable_2/dotproject/modules/files/

E-mail notification system now utilizes dotProject's mail routine and
has been completely overhauled.  The plain text email notifications 
that are sent out are not the prettiest, but focus on providing all
information related to the item and HTML notifications are forthcoming.

English translation files included.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
       * When upgrading from a previous Help Desk module *

1.) Remember to go back into the module configuration to setup new
    configuration parameters!  A number of additions and changes
    have been made to the configuration pane that require you to
    verify all the new settings and save them before the module
    will operate properly.
