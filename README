ABOUT

    This is the dotProject Help Desk Module.  If you would like to contribute
    to this project, please contact one of the maintainers.

PERMISSIONS

    The Help Desk uses built in dotProject permissions to its best abilities. The
    permission system is layed out as follows.

    1. Permissions to the Help Desk module overwrite company permissions. For
    instance, if a user has read-write access to a company but has read only
    access to Help Desk, overall read only access will result. A user must have
    read-write permissions to Help Desk in order to be able to create and edit
    items.

    2. Company permissions are used to determine access to Help Desk items. If
    a user has read only permissions for company X, the user will be able to
    only read items associated with company X. If the user has read-write
    access to company X, the user will be able to create items for company X,
    but not for any other company. Having read only permission to a company
    will not allow the user to create items for that company.  The user must
    have read-write permissions to at least one company in order to be able to
    create Help Desk items.

    3. If a user has created an item for company X, but later his read-write
    permissions for company X have been removed, the user will still be able to
    edit that item. If the user's Help Desk read-write permissions have been
    also removed, the user will no longer be able to edit any items.  These
    individual permissions are in place for all items a user has created.

    4. On the configuration screen, there are two options of note. The first
    option has to do with the company which handles Help Desk items.If a user
    has read-write access to company X, the user will be able to assign items
    to users from company X. The user will also be able to select from a list
    of users in company X for the "requestor" of an item. If a company is
    assigned in the configuration screen, users from that company will be added
    to those two lists. This is done so that users can assign items to people
    from the company that hosts the Help Desk. This is useful if Help Desk
    staff don't have time to go through and assign items to themselves.
    
    The second option has to do with items which have no company assigned. By
    default, those items are not readable by random users.
