1) Ensure that you have a current backup of your current dotProject database. This step isn't strictly needed but is never a bad idea.

2) Untar the downloaded compressed file and place the "helpdesk" folder in the "module" folder of your dotproject directory.

3) Go to "System Admin-->View Modules", you should be able to see a list of modules, including the Helpdesk.

4) For upgraders only: the line for the Helpdesk should have been marked with a green button. Please click on the "upgrade" link.

5) For new users only: the line for the Helpdesk should have been marked with a grey button. Please click on the "install" link (the only link available for the Helpdesk at this moment). Then, the Helpdesk should have a green button. 

6) If you see a blinking yellow button for the Helpdesk, please click on the "disabled" link. If you see a blinking red button for the Helpdesk, please click on the "hidden" link in the rightmost column.

7) In order to create helpdesk items from emails, it is necessary to configure the "newgateway.pl" manually. Please refer to the comments in the script (mainly in the "System Setting Section" and the "Configuration Section").
   You may also have to configure your mail server to pipe emails to the perl script. For example, you can add a new alias in "/etc/aliases" by adding the following line: (we assume you use support@yourcompany.com as the address to receive and send helpdesk items emails).
    support: "|/your_helpdesk_directory/newgateway.pl /your_dotproject_direcotory/includes/config.php /your_helpdesk_directory/config.php".

Now, you are good to go!
